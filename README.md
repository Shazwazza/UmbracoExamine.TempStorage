==========================

Umbraco Examine providers that allow temporary storage of the index in the local CodeGen folder if the site is hosted on a network file share to avoid latency issues.

## Docs

The purpose of these providers is to work on an index in local temporary storage on the current machine. The resulting index paths will result in a path similar to:

> C:\Users\SomeGuy\AppData\Local\Temp\Temporary ASP.NET Files\root\56bd1092\483dcbb9\App_Data\TEMP\ExamineIndexes\InternalMember\

Update ExamineSettings.config:

Change the content indexers (i.e. InternalIndexer, ExternalIndexer) to be of type:

    UmbracoExamine.TempStorage.UmbracoTempStorageContentIndexer, UmbracoExamine.TempStorage
  
Change the member indexers (i.e. InternalMemberIndexer) to be of type:

    UmbracoExamine.TempStorage.UmbracoTempStorageMemberIndexer, UmbracoExamine.TempStorage
  
Change the searchers to be of type:

    UmbracoExamine.TempStorage.UmbracoTempStorageSearcher, UmbracoExamine.TempStorage
